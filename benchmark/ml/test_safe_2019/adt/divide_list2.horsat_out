analyzing /home/katsura/hflmc2/benchmark/ml/test_safe_2019/adt/divide_list2.hors...
The number of rewrite rules: 157
The size of recursion scheme: 2049
The number of states: 1
size of ACG: 2434
The property is NOT satisfied.
A counterexample is:
(br,1)(l0,1)(br,2)(l0,1)(br,2)(l0,1)(br,2)(l0,1)(l0,1)(br,2)(l0,1)(br,2)(br,1)(l1,1)(l0,1)(br,2)(br,2)(l0,1)(br,2)(l1,1)(event_fail,0)
